# 2. Data Driven UI

Date: 2022-09-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This service should be adoptable by mulitple local authorities and each local authority would want to offer repair triage options appropriate to them.

## Decision

The service will use configuration to define the triage options available to users. This would include early exit pages (i.e. emergency and non-eligible) and triage options with up to 3 stages.

## Consequences

No code changes related to repair triage options would be required for adoption.
