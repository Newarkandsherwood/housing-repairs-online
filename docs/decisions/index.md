# Architecture Descision Records

An architectural decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. Further information can be found on Michael Nygard's blog.

## Tools

ADRs are generated and maintained using Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools). As each ADR is plain text, they may be added without the tools - however the tools do help maintain consistency.
